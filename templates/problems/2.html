<h1 style="text-align: center;">SantaFe's ant journey&nbsp;</h1><div>The artificial ant problem is described by Koza. &nbsp;It is a well studied problem and was chosen as it has a simple fitness function. Briefly the problem is to devise a program which can successfully navigate an artificial ant along a twisting trail on a square &nbsp;toroidal grid. The program can use three operations, Move, Right and Left, to move the ant forward one square, turn to the right or turn to the left. Each of these operations takes one time unit. The sensing function IfFoodAhead looks into the square the ant is currently facing and then executes one of its two arguments depending upon whether that square contains food or is empty. Two other functions, Prog2 and Prog3, are provided. These take two and three arguments respectively which are executed in sequence.</div>
